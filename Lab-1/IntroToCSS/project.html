        <h1>Take a world cruise</h1>
        <h4 class="def">If youâ€™re looking to travel the world by sea, a world cruise can provide the flexibility to explore multiple continents, traveling from the U.S. to Europe for example, or to hone in on one continent. Itineraries vary by cruise, and world cruises can be great for families, retirees or those who can be at sea for around three months. <br>

Sometimes, cruise lines will offer the option to book only a segment of world cruise, which can range from two weeks to a month. To book a segment, prospective travelers will also have to add a one-way trip to or from the start or end of their journey. <br>

The costs of world cruises can be anywhere from $13,000 to upwards of $40,000 per person, as <strong>Cruise</strong> points out.</h4>
